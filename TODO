Build:

  decide on build tool: ant ? maven ? custom with rake ?

Interfaces:
    add a countable interface with a size method

  IntSet ->
    abstract empty and merge as part of monoid interface
    abstract add/remove abstraction (check clojure api)
    type the recursive thing correctly

Tests:

  Add test framework

  Contract api that takes an interface and verify propertie on the interface
  can then be combined with a Generator of concrete implementation
