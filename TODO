IntBst:
  implement java Collection, Set, Iterable
  add equality as static method

Interfaces:
    remove container and put has(int) into IntSet

    add a countable interface with a size method

  IntSet ->
    abstract empty and merge as part of monoid interface
    abstract add/remove abstraction (check clojure api)
    type the recursive thing correctly

Build:
  integrate with jruby rake + ant build

Tests:

  add contract test, for now as ruby module for every contracts and their mixes


  Contract api that takes an interface and verify propertie on the interface
  can then be combined with a Generator of concrete implementation
