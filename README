This project contains Java implementations of some of the immutable and
persistent data structures described in the book "Purely Functional Data
Structures" by Chris Okasaki.

In addition it will try to incorporate ideas found in clojure libraries like
clojure.core.reducer or transients.

It is essentially a personal exercise in comprehension and assimilation.

The implementations will be based on java 8 and make use of the lambda
feature as well as the new standard functional interfaces. This project
briefly started as a Scala project until I decided to instead use plain
Java after asking myself about the long term value of Scala source code,
especially for the purpose of writing jvm based libraries.
