This project contains Java implementations of some of the immutable and
persistent data structures described in the book "Purely Functional Data
Structures" by Chris Okasaki.

In addition this project incorporate ideas found in Clojure collection
libraries like clojure.core.reducer or transients, and loosely follows
its collection abstractions.

It is essentially a personal exercise in comprehension and assimilation.

The implementations will be based on Java 8 and make use of the new lambdas
and functional interface features, as well as the possibility for default
implementation in interfaces.

This project briefly started as a Scala project until I decided to instead
use plain Java after asking myself about the long term value of writing jvm
based libraries in Scala, and realizing that the new features of java 8 now
offers much of what is needed for developing and using functional oriented
api and libraries in a practical way for both producers and consumers.
